\section{Nilpotent Groups}

We enumerate here some well known results about nilpotent groups that will be used throughout. The proofs of these results can be found in the references, and are omitted here since the exposition of this subject benefits immensely from a more comprehensive treatment.

\begin{definition}
    Let $G$ be a group. The groups $\gamma_i(G)$ are defined by induction as:
    $$
    \gamma_1(G) = G; \quad \gamma_{i+1} = \left[\gamma_i(G), G\right].
    $$ 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    A group $G$ is \textbf{nilpotent} if there is an integer $c$ such that $\gamma_{c+1}(G) = 1$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    \cite[p.~116]{RotmanITG}
    A finite group $H$ is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    \cite[p.~117]{RotmanITG}
    \label{S1NG:maxsub}
    If $H$ is a finite $p$-group, then every maximal subgroup of $H$ is normal and has index $p$.
\end{theorem}
