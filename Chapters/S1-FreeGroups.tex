\section{Free Groups}

This section offers a concise overview of fundamental properties of free groups, focusing on the essential information required for our specific objectives. 
Once again the proofs can be found in the cited references.

\begin{definition}
    Let $X$ be a subset of a group $F$. We say that $F$ is a \textbf{free group with basis $X$} if, for every group $G$ and every function $f \colon X \rightarrow G$, there exists a unique homomorphism $\varphi \colon F \rightarrow G$ extending $f$ ($\varphi |_X = f$).
\end{definition}

Let us note that if $F$ is a \textbf{free group with basis $X$} and denoting by $i \colon X \rightarrow F$ the inclusion, then the following diagram commutes

\begin{theorem}
    \cite[Theorem 11.1]{RotmanITG}
    Given a set $X$, there exists a free group with basis $X$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    \cite[Theorem 11.4]{RotmanITG}
    Let $F$ and $G$ be free groups with bases $X$ and $Y$, respectively. 
    Then $F \cong G$ if and only if $\card{X} = \card{Y}$. 
\end{theorem}

Taking $G$ as $F$ it easily follows from the last theorem that any basis $X$ of a free group $F$ has the same number of elements.

\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{rank} of a free group $F$, denoted by $\mathbf{rank(F)}$, is the number of elements in a basis of $F$. 
\end{definition}
