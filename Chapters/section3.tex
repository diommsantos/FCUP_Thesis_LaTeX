\chapter{Minimal number of generators of a group}

In this section we study the structure of finite groups with the following property: any non-trivial group quotient is generated by less elements that the group itself. 
We will start with the simpler case of when $d(H) > 1$ but $d(H/N) \le 1$ for every non-trivial normal subgroup $N$ of $H$. 
Later we will provide a more detailed account of a Theorem mostly proved in \cite{DallaVoltaFGNMGAPQ}, the generalization to the case in which $d(H) > m$ but $d(H/N) \le m$ for every positive integer $m$ and every non-trivial normal subgroup $N$.
