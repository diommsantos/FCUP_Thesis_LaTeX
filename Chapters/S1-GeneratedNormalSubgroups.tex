\section{Normal closure}

Similar to what is done for subgroups (for example in \cite{RotmanITG}) is possible to define normal subgroups generated by a set.

\begin{theorem}
    \label{gnsub}
    The intersection of any family of normal subgroups of a group $G$ is again a normal subgroup of $G$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\left\{ S_i |i \in I \right\}$ be a family of subgroups of $G$. It is well known that $\bigcap_{i \in I} S_i$ is a subgroup. Furthermore for any $i \in I$ and $g \in G$, $gS_ig^{-1} = S_i$ and thus $g(\bigcap_{i \in I} S_i)g^{-1} = \bigcap_{i \in I} gS_ig^{-1} = \bigcap_{i \in I} S_i$.  
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    If $X$ is a subset of a group $G$, then there is a \textbf{smallest} normal subgroup $H$ of $G$ containing $X$; that is if $X \subseteq S$ and $S \le G$, then $H \le S$.   
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    There are normal subgroups of $G$ containing $X$; for example, $G$ itself is normal and contains $X$; let us define $H$ as the intersection of all the normal subgroups of $G$ which contain $X$. Also let us note that $H$ is a normal subgroup, by Theorem \ref{gnsub}, and $X \subseteq H$. If $S \le G$ and $X \in S$, then $S$ is one of the subgroups of $G$ being intersected to form $H$; hence, $H \le S$, and so $H$ is the smallest such subgroup.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
    If $X$ is a subset of a group $G$, then the smallest normal subgroup of $G$ containing $X$, denoted by $\subgen{X}_G$, is called the \textbf{normal closure of $X$}. If $X$ is a finite set, say $X = \{a_1, ..., a_n \}$ then we write $\subgen{X}_G = \subgen{a_1, ..., a_n}_G$ instead of $\subgen{X}_G = \subgen{\left\{a_1, ..., a_n\right\}}_G$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $G$ be a group and $X$ a subset of $G$. The normal closure of $X$ is the group $W = \subgen{\left\{gxg^{-1}|g \in G, x \in X\right\}}$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    If $y \in W$ then $y$ is a word on elements of $\left\{gxg^{-1}|g \in G, x \in X\right\}$, say $y = w_1...w_n$. Obviously for any $g \in G$, $gyg^{-1} =gw_1g^{-1}...gw_ng^{-1}$ is also a word on elements of $\left\{gxg^{-1}|g \in G, x \in X\right\}$. We have thus proved that $W$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ and since $\subgen{X}_G$ is the smallest normal subgroup that contains $X$, we have that $\subgen{X}_G \subseteq W$.
    
    On the other hand since $\subgen{X}_G$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ that contains $X$, it obviously contains $gxg^{-1}$ for any $x \in X$, $g \in G$. Thus $W \subseteq \subgen{X}_G$.
\end{proof}
